## Explanation

Music is a huge part of the lives of many people. Bloc Jams makes it convenient for people to choose and listen to their favorite music wherever they can access the internet. 

## Problem

People want to be able to listen to music that they enjoy without having to carry around their CDs, MP3s, or their own computer. No matter where they are, they want to be able to listen to any device that can connect to the internet (desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc.).

## Solution

BlocJams is comprised of three pages: a homepage, a collection page, and an album page. The user can navigate from page to page easily. On the collection page, the user can choose his/her favorite album which will lead to the album page. On the album page, the user will see all pertinent album information, an image of the album, a player bar, and a track list. The player bar allows users to raise or lower the volume, switch between songs, and skip to a certain part of a song. If the user chooses, he/she can use the track list to pause and play songs intstead of the player bar. The application is designed to provide an enjoyable user experience on any size device. 

## Results

I had a colleague test the Bloc Jams application at several points during its development process. He gave feedback that the application was user friendly, made logical sense, and performed as expected. He said that he would definitely use the application.

## Conclusion

I learned an enormous amount about front-end web development while creating Bloc Jams. I was very surprised how much measurement was involved in the animation on the home page and in the player bar. I was amazed at how complex the JavaScript and jQuery became toward the end of the project. If I had to do the project over again, I would have kept better track of all of the variables and function names. I plan on refactoring the code to allow the application to hold an infinite amount of albums (right now it can only hold 12).
