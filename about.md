For most of her career, Heather bravely entered the hormonal world of teens and pre-teens in order to teach math and reading to struggling, mostly reluctant students. Her experience with this population has prepared her for the creative problem solving she needs in web development. 

In several years, Heatherâ€™s teaching experience will be even more relevant when she is looking for a position with an organization whose purpose is to teach underprivileged teenage girls to code, thus motivating them to enter the STEM fields.

Heather is especially skilled at collaborating and communicating with teams to work toward common goals. She has an eye for detail, is highly organized, and is able to remain calm and flexible in high-stress situations.

After she completes the Bloc web development program, Heather plans to work on personal projects while trying to find a junior web developer position, internship or apprenticeship in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania or with a remote company. She would love to work with a diverse and forward-thinking company. Heather enjoys both front-end and back-end development, so a full-stack position would be ideal. She is hoping to find a company that has a strong mentoring program.
